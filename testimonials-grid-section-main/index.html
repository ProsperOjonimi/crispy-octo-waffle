                I recieved a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned<br />
                were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I<br />
                honestly feel I got every penny's worth.

                transition and have heard some people who had an amazing
                experience here. I signed up for<br />
                the free inro course and found it incredibly fun!I enrolled
                shortly thereafter. The next 12<br />
                weeks was the best-and most grueling-time of my life. Since
                completing the course, I've<br />
                successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at
                a VR startup "

              " Before joining the bootcamp, I've<br />
              never written a line of code. I needed<br />
              some structure from proffessionals<br />
              who can help me learn programming<br />
              step by step. I was encouraged to<br />
              enroll by a former student of theirs<br />
              who can only say wonderful things<br />
              about the program. The entire<br />
              curriculum and staff did not<br />
              disappoint. They were very hands-on<br />
              and I never had to wait long for<br />
              assistance. The agile team project, in<br />
              particular, was outstanding. It took<br />
              my learning to the next level in a way<br />
              that no tutorial could ever have. In<br />
              fact, I've often referred to it during<br />
              interviews as an example of my<br />
              development experience. It certainly<br />
              helped me land a job as a full-stack<br />
              developer after recieving multiple<br />
              offers. 100% recommend!"
